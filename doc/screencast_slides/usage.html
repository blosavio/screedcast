        Candy Bicycle Screencast 2 — Usage
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use a screencast to augment written documents.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Some people learn/understand audio-visual better than written examples.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The visual component of a screencast is an <span class="small-caps">html</span> file rendered by a web-browser.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I suggest putting the browser into <em>Full Screen</em> mode and adjusting the zoom so that the text fills the middle 50% of the screen. This
            screencast is currently adjusted for my screen; you may have to tweak it for your own screen.

        Speaker notes
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Notes for the speaker may be included in a hidden <span class="small-caps">html</span> div.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The intention is that the notes will be visible for rehearsal, but hidden for recording. Perhaps the speaker could have the speaker notes displayed
            off to the side on a laptop running the same screencast section.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Speaker notes appear as orange text to distinguish from main content, and as a warning while recording that they should be hidden.

      </ul>

      <h3>
        Pseudo-evaluated code examples
      </h3>
      <p>
        During a screencast, it's often desirable to discuss an expression without being distracted by what the result with be. Screedcast offers a facility
        for simulating an evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click/tap Clojure code examples to reveal the expression's evaluation.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="form">(map inc [1 2 3])</code><br><code class="eval">;; =&gt; (2 3 4)</code></pre>
      <p>
        Giving the impression of being at the <span class="small-caps">repl</span> also makes the screencast a little more familiar and engaging.
      </p>
      <div class="vspace"></div>
      <p>
        If a panel contains many code examples, you may want to re-hide the evaluations as you work your way through the discussion. Click/tap the expression
        again (not the evaluation) to re-hide.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Speaker note: <strong>Way</strong> too much text on this panel. Not a good example of a screencast panel.

      <div class="panel-footer">
        <span class="panel-number">3/5</span><span class="footer-link">https://example.com/candy-bicycle</span>

      <h3>
        Precise navigation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Don't bother to drag the scroll-bar or use the mouse scroll wheel. Clicking the headers/footers will always advance exactly one screenful.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you bump it and the screen gets a little bit displaced, simply click the nearest header/footer to precisely re-align the panel with the screen.
      </p>
      <div class="panel-footer">
        <span class="panel-number">4/5</span><span class="footer-link">https://example.com/candy-bicycle</span>

      <h3>
        What's next.

      <ol class="de-highlight whats-next">

          A good way to wrap up a screencast section is to put it into context. The 'What's Next' panel tells us what we just discussed and highlights the next
          topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular screencast series contains three sections. Since we just discussed <em>Using</em> Screedcast (section #2), we'll follow that up with
          a discussion on how to <em>Create</em> a screencast (section #3).

        <p>
          And since we're here, scroll just a tiny bit further to see the copyright and license banners. Clicking the copyright section will toggle the speaker
          notes.
